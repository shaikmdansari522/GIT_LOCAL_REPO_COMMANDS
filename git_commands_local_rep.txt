Step:-1 Create the working directory by giving the command

	mkdir folder_name

Step:-2 Enter in the working directory, type the command

	cd folder_name 

Step:-3 Initialize the git in the directory, type the command
	
	git init

Step:-4 After initializing the git, created or modified can be added to local repo of git by typing the command

	git add file_name (or) git add -A .

Step:-5 we check the status of files whether is it in untrack or track stage,

	git status
	
	i)  If the file is in untrack stage, then we can type the step-4 command to enter in stageing area [Track stage]
	ii) if the file is in track stage, then files are going to commit in the local repo

Step:-6 Commit to local repo, type the command

	git commit -m "Message name to commit"

Step:-7 To check the logs of the commit in the form of decorate way, then type the command

	git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

Step:-8 To see the full log details, type

	git log

Step:-9 To see the particular commit, then type

	git show commit_id

Step:-10 To create the branch, then type

	git branch branch_name (or) git checkout -b branch_name [This will create branxh and checkout as branch name]

Step:-11 To checkout as branch or master, then type 

	git checkout [branch_name or  master]

Step:-12 To create the tag for the commits, then type

	git tag --a tag_name commit_id --m "message of tag version"

Step:-13 To see the tags then type

	git tag

Step:-14 To merge branch with master, then type 

	git checkout master
	git merge branch_name

Step:-15 To see how many branchs are created, then type

	git branch

Step:-16 To see the difference between two commit of same files then, type 

	git diff commit_id_1 commit_id_2

Step:-17 If we want to undo the files after the commit then, type

	git checkout commit_id [it will create branch of commit_id then undo it]
	
	other way to undo is,

	git revert commit_id

Step:-18 To delete the files in the staging and local repo, then type

	git reset commit_id [After typing this command, whatever track files are there, it becomes untracked]

Step:-19 To delete from working, staging and local repo then. type

	git  reset --hard commit_id


======== WORKING ON REMOTE DIRECTORY ==========

Step:-1 To  clone from the git, type

	git clone url_name_of_git

Step:-2 To check with remote repo, type

	git remote -v

Step:-3 To push the code from local master to remote repo, type

	git push origin url_git_repo 

Step:-4 To push the tags, then type

	git push origin --tags

=========== Stashing ======================

Step:-1 Stashing is used to save the work in reference without commiting, type command

	git add file_name [or] git add -A .

	git stash save "Message name "

	git stash list [to see the stash list]
